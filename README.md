Defence Security System

Technology:
IoT Hardware, Deep Learning (CNN)

Project Description:
This project focuses on enhancing defence security by using IoT technology and deep learning techniques to detect and classify flying objects. The system predicts whether an object is malicious or non-threatening based on real-time data.

The project includes the following components:
•	IoT Hardware: Captures real-time data from sensors (e.g., radar, ultrasonic).
•	Deep Learning (CNN): A Convolutional Neural Network processes the data to classify flying objects.
Key Objectives:
1.	Data Collection: IoT devices capture real-time information about flying objects.
2.	Object Classification: Using a CNN model, we classify objects like airplanes, helicopters, birds, drones, or unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs).
3.	Threat Detection: The system predicts if the flying object is malicious or not, providing timely alerts to enhance defence mechanisms.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes images and sensor data from different flying objects such as drones, airplanes, birds, and UAVs. You can collect data using your IoT devices or find relevant datasets online for training the CNN model.

Results:
The system detects objects and classifies them as malicious or non-malicious based on the processed data from IoT sensors and the CNN model. The performance is evaluated using accuracy and precision metrics.
